    "## Q1 Difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
    "Ans- Compiled: Translated into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++).\n",
    "- Interpreted: Executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2 What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Ans Exception handling allows you to catch and manage errors during program execution using try, except, finally, and else blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "Ans The finally block is always executed, whether an exception occurs or not. It is used to clean up resources, like closing files or releasing locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4 What is logging in Python?\n",
    "Ans Logging is the process of recording messages for debugging and monitoring purposes. It provides a way to track events that happen during code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "Ans __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup but is not reliable for critical resources due to uncertain timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6 Difference between import and from ... import\n",
    "Ans - import module: Imports the entire module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- from module import name: Imports only the specified object/function/class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7 How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Using Multiple Except Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can catch multiple exceptions by writing separate except blocks for each exception. This approach is useful when you need to handle different exceptions differently. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "##### Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "print(\"You can't divide by zero\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "print(\"Invalid value\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Single Except Block\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to handle multiple exceptions in the same way, you can group them in a single except block using a tuple. This approach avoids code duplication and simplifies the code. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "##### Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "result = int(\"abc\")\n",
    "except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n",
    "print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8 What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "Ans Ensures proper acquisition and release of resources (like files). Automatically closes the file even if an error occurs.\n",
    "- with open('file.txt') as f:\n",
    "    - data = f.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q9 What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
    "Ans Multithreading: Multiple threads in the same process (shared memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiprocessing: Multiple processes with separate memory spaces (better for CPU-bound tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Q10 What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Better than print() for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjustable levels (DEBUG, INFO, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output to files, streams, or remote systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time-stamped and categorized logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q11 What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "Ans Python uses automatic memory management, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference counting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Garbage collection for unused objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic memory allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q12 What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Ans try: Wrap code that might fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- except: Handle specific or generic exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- else: Executes if no exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- finally: Executes always.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q13 Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "Ans It ensures efficient use of memory, prevents leaks, and improves program performance and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q14 What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "Ans try: Executes potentially risky code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- except: Catches and handles exceptions if they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q15 How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "Ans Based on reference counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a cyclic garbage collector to detect and collect reference cycles that can’t be freed by counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q16 What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "Ans Executed only if the try block doesn’t raise an exception. Useful for code that should only run if no error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q17 What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "Ans DEBUG: Detailed info for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- INFO: Confirmation that things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WARNING: Something unexpected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ERROR: A serious issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CRITICAL: Very serious error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q18 What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "Ans os.fork() is Unix-only, low-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- multiprocessing is high-level, cross-platform, and more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q19 What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "Ans Prevents memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures data is written to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Releases system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Q20 What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "Ans read(): Reads the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- readline(): Reads one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q21 What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
    "Ans A built-in module to record log messages. Used for tracking application behavior in a standardized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q22 What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
    "Ans Provides functions for interacting with the OS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- File paths (os.path)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- File system navigation (os.listdir, os.remove)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q23 What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "Ans Circular references\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory fragmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unintentional retention (memory leaks)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance overhead of garbage collector\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q24 How do you raise an exception manually in Python? \n",
    "Ans raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "- Used to signal errors in user-defined conditions.\n",
    "## Q25 Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "Ans Useful for I/O-bound tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "- File reading\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network calls\n",
    "- Helps in improving responsiveness without spawning heavy processes."
